## - The Feel, Process, and Results


Though my journey with Rails has been short thus far, I feel like I have learned an incredible of knowledge in that short time, and the best part is that there is so much more to learn. My project is a site where users can add movies to their list, view others lists, create new movies/actors, and more. Similar to previous projects I have completed, scope creep was a real issue for me. However, after getting some good advice from an instructor, I realized my project already showed the skills that I wanted to show at this time. 

The biggest takeaway I have from this project is that I really love Rails. I feel like I have a good understanding of what's going on under the hood, but Rails makes life as a programmer very easy when used properly. As I said above, the great part is that there is still so much more I can learn about Rails and the help it can give us as programmers.

Comparing the Rails project to the Sinatra project, I think one of my biggest improvements was delegating correctly in an MVC structure. In the Sinatra project, I had a lot of logic in my controllers instead of in my models. I really focused on trying to clean up the controllers using callbacks and properly placed methods. Though it's not perfect, the comparison in projects is night and day.

The most difficult part of the project was the custom attribute writer. The way the project is set up, I have a form_for with a fields_for and then a nested fields_for. I had some difficulty getting all the fields to work together. However, I got the method working early in the project, and then came back and refactored the method later in the project. I'm still not 100% happy with the custom attribute writer, but it's much better after the refactor.

Overall, this has been my favorite project so far. Rails is a joy to work with and I look forward to continuing to improve my skills. I feel I have come a long way in thinking like a programmer and understanding why conventions are what they are. My debugging skills are continuing to improve, which had increased my efficiency quite a bit. Going forward, I hope to make the same leaps in skill that I have in past projects. Happy Coding!
