I must admit, I was concerned going into my portfolio project. Prior to this almost all tests had been written for me in labs and I had relied heavily on those to get through each lab. I felt like I was learning, but starting your own program from scratch without a lot of direction can be intimidating.

I spent a lot more time on this project than I probably should have. Not because my project is the best or has the most features, but because of how ineffecient I was in creating something from scratch. I constantly jumped around to different portions of my program and generally didn't plan super well. Even though I wasted a lot of time by not planning from the very beginning, I learned a valuable lessson in planning and have been implementing that lesson already.

To go along with planning, I wish I would have created a test suite from the beginning. Even though I'm still a bit of newbie, I am strong believer in TDD. I spent so much time testing my program in weird ways. If I would have just wrote tests in the planning stage, it would have saved me a lot of time in Pry.

I'm proud of what I created. I'm not proud of how the code is laid out as I'm sure it can be refactored into much more readable code, but I am proud that I was able to create a program that scrapes multiple webpages and allows users to interact with that data. 

I certainly didn't think I was an expert before this project, but other than gaining some confidence in my abilities, I learned there is so much more to learn. In all reality, I could have spent months on this project adding all sorts of cool features to my program. I guess part of what makes programming exciting is continously learning about new features I can add or a better way of doing things to make my program better.

Technically, I still am struggling a bit with understanding how to make classes relate to one another the way I would like them too. My top priority while moving forward and continuing to learn is to keep working to understand class relationships so I can manipulate objects to interact the way I would like. Refactoring this code will be a priority moving forward. 

Overall, I believe I'm starting to think more and more like a programmer. I always thought of programming as something that was pure logic, and clearly lots of logic is involved, but it's really about being able to think outside the box as well, which makes it all the more exciting!
