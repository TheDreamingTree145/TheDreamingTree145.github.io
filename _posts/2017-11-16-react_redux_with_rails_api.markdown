To be completely honest, going into this application, I was feeling much less comfortable with what to do than I had been with previous apps. Specifically, Rails is so convention based that there is a generally well defined way to do something. Of course, in React and Redux there are rules and conventions, but also more room for your own interpretation.

My biggest challenge was understanding how data would flow through the application. As stated before, I didn't really have a good understanding of how that was happening.  However, when it comes down to it, it really is pretty basic. Redux holds the store which will hold the state. With the help of redux we are able to pass down the state throughout the application.

I've discovered React is an amazing tool. With the virtual DOM only re-rendering what is changing, instead of re-rending the entire DOM wen there is a change, React becomes an extremely efficient tool in modern web development. With websites being so interactive, re-rendering the entire DOM everytime there is a change can be very inefficient.


The Rails API was the least difficult part of this app for myself. There is such great documentation on Rails and as I said up above, Rails is convention based, so there is a couple of generally accepted ways of doing things. After working with Rails for the past few months, React and Redux were interesting changes and a welcome tool in the toolbox.

I implemented my first framework with this application. After looking at a few that were popular to use with React, I settled on Semantic UI. I understood what frameworks did prior to this app. However, I am only now understanding how useful they really are. For me, it required quite a bit of experimentation as I wasn't really familiar how documentation was laid out for a framework, but as I implemented it page by page, it became less experimenting and more getting exactly what I wanted out of the framework. Semantic was extremely easy to add to the app and I highly recommend it for others with a React app.

I really look forward to learning more about the power that React holds. I feel as though I have a good handle on how to build with React, but definitely understand that I've only begun to scratch the surface of what can be done with React. I see the usefullness of Redux, especially with larger applications, and although its used a lot with React, it's good to know it can be used with other tools such as Angular.

Overall, I'm happy with the way my project turned out. There were definitely challenges, and I feel I could have structured my application better, but I was able to get what I wanted working. I plan on continuing to update the app and add some more features such as an authentication system. That's what I love so much about coding. There is always something new and challenging to take on. Continuous learning is an important part in all aspect of my life, and coding fits in perfectly.
