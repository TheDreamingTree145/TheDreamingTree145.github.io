When I first began programming, I hear of Ruby on Rails and ActiveRecord before I really even learned anything else about the ruby language. Their use is so widespread, it's almost as if vanilla ruby doesn't exist. There were times when I questioned why I wasn't being taught ActiveRecord or Rails right away and instead needed to build out my own methods.

Yet, as I get further and further in my learning about Ruby, I realize more and more how important it is to understand why something is working. In the beginning of my journey, I was able to get my tests passing and programs working consistently with trial and error, but many times I didn't truly understand why that particular code worked.

I wouldn't say that ever caught up to me in negative way, but I did become more cognizant as what I am learning becomes more and more complex. Specifically, during ActiveRecord associations and migrations I found myself going back and back and back to old lessons, labs, and the Internet. Now that in particular isn't a bad thing. Of course it's easy to forget a syntax issue here or small rule here, but I found myself not understanding what was going on under the hood.

Luckily, I was able to catch this early before getting to more and more complex libraries and projects. It was an important lesson to learn. Rather than rushing to move along in a curriculum or project, it's a lot better to take the extra time to really understand what's under the hood and know why. In the short term, you may lose time, but in the long run, you'll make that time back and then some! Happy coding!
