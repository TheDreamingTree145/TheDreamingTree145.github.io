Recently, I undertook the task of overhauling parts of a Rails application I built and adding in JavaScript functionality using JSON and JQuery. I really enjoyed Rails and vanilla Ruby from the day I started my journey, but what I learned from working on this update is the power of JavaScript. The added functionality and ability to improve the user experience using JavaScript is something I look forward to continuing to learn and improve upon in years to come.

Specifically, I added the ability to create a new object and to display that data without a page refresh using a JSON backend, rendered an index resource with a JSON backend to render data, and a show page where users can click to the next object without a refresh.

The most difficult part I found was understanding how JavaScript and Rails work together and the passing of data between the two. I found it to be a complex idea and it seemed I would have difficulty understanding. However, once you understand to use JQuery and AJAX requests, the idea simplifies. After getting return data from the AJAX request, it's as simple as using the return data to change the DOM.

This update helped me nail some of the fundementals of JavaScript down. Specifically understanding callbacks and their uses. While I feel I understood callbacks prior to making these changes, I have a better understanding of the purpose of callbacks and the reason for implementing them.

Like the other apps and major updates I have created this was a great learning experience. Tutorials and short demos are very valuable, but creating something on your own is really where the best learning takes place. You are really required to know your own code and understand not just how to do something, but also why you are doing it. Coding is a never-ending learning journey, but this was a great step.
