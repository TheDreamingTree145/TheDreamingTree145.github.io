For my second portfolio project, I decided to make a simple workout tracker website. On the site you are able to create workouts and exercises and add them to your profile. The focus for this project wasn't necessarily to make the site pretty, but to make it fully functioning.

Starting a portfolio project can feel overwhelming. I believe in programming it's very easy to forget or downplay what you do know, and think more about everything that you don't. Personally, that is one thing that I tried to focus on heavily before starting the project. Attitude is everything, and that even applies to programming.

In my last portfolio project, some of blog post talked about my lack of planning. I am happy to say that this time around I planned much better. Far from perfect, but improved enough to make a noticeable difference. Going in with a plan really helped me be much more efficient in my coding, rather than having new features I want to add constantly pop up. New features popping up still happened, but instead of being necessities that needed to be added, they were nice extras to add on.

I wanted to challenge myself in some ways, specifically in the way my objects were associated. While the project only necessitates that you have one has_many relationship, the way my site was built, it would have far more than that. I have users who has_many workouts and exercises, workouts who has_many users and exercises, and exercises that has_many users and workouts. This led me to read more documentation about associations than I had done before and that was extremely helpful throughout the project.

This project taught me an incredible amount how to properly put together a website with many different pages and features. I still have a lot to learn about routes when websites become more complex, but this project was a great learning experience. Making everything interact properly and efficiently for the best user experience can become incredibly complex quickly. It's incredibly important to plan correctly so you're not constantly jumping around wasting time figuring what to do next.  Overall, I'm happy with how my project has turned out. It could be prettier, but pretty isn't always the best.
