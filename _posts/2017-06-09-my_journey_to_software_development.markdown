While I've only just recently taken the plunge to dive deep into the world of programming, it has been a thought in my mind for many years, I just thought it was too late in my life to make the switch. I'll spare the details of what in my life has led to me the point that I'm taking the plunge, but I wouldn't have it any other way.

There are a few main reasons that I've been drawn into programming and creating. The first being that I am a problem solver and creator. I've always been a very logical thinker, but am able to go outside the box when necessary. However, I never really found anything where I could channel that combination and create until I started doing a bit of programming. Learning to program has given me an outlet for a specific combination of skills that I believe lend themselves well to the software field.

Along with being able to create and utilize my skills properly, I've always wanted to make a difference. All jobs make a difference in some way, shape or form, but I've always wanted to help people. Now engineering software may not be the same as working at a soup kitchen, but it does give me the opportunity to help others achieve tasks in a more efficient manner. To me, time is the most important thing I have, and if I can help others and myself have more time, that is a win in my book.

I don't anticipate this being an easy journey, nor one that will end quickly or when I finish at Flatiron School. Another reason software development became my focus was due to the field constantly changing. This always brings something new to learn and new challenges to conquer. I don't ever want to be complacent in my ability to learn and improve in my work or personal life and I appreciate how rapidly the technology field changes.

While not a comprehensive list, this a good summary of main points on why I chose software development as a challenge and future of my life. I look forward to continually learning and improving my skills to become the best developer and person that I can be!
