<p>I am a 29 year old with a Bachelor's of Business Administration, who has spent the last few years in sales. After dabbling every so slightly in programming a few years ago, I knew it was something I was very interested in. I came to a crossroads in my life, and I made the tough decision to leave the sales world purse my programming passion, which led me to Flatiron School's Web Developer Program. I am pursuing completion of the program and seeking a career and future in software development!</p>
